# MYSQL-
Anlaysing Database queries in My SQL

In this project, I was tasked complete queries in the syntax used in MYSQL. 

In MySQL1, I worked with a database called 'store' in which I created queries to explore customer details, applied formulas for  discount factors and used nested formaulas to deliver queries. 

In My SQL2, I worked with a database called 'world' in which I exploered the population and life expectancy of different countries and cities, created formualas and applied filters.
